# Python - Variable Annotations

## Introduction

This project introduces variable annotations in Python. By the end of this project, you should be able to understand and implement type annotations, appreciate duck typing, and validate your code using `mypy`.

## Concepts

- Advanced Python

## Resources

- [Python 3 typing documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/typing.html)
- [MyPy cheat sheet](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/cheat_sheet_py3.html)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- Type annotations in Python 3
- How to use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types
- Duck typing
- How to validate your code with mypy

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using `python3` (version 3.7)
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5.)
- All your files must be executable
- Ensure all your modules, classes, and functions have correct documentation

## Tasks

### 0. Basic annotations - add

Write a type-annotated function `add` that takes a float `a` and a float `b` as arguments and returns their sum as a float.
File: `0-add.py`

### 1. Basic annotations - concat

Write a type-annotated function `concat` that takes a string `str1` and a string `str2` as arguments and returns a concatenated string.
File: `1-concat.py`

... (and so on for the rest of the tasks)
