# Python Asynchronous Comprehensions and Generators

This repository is dedicated to mastering asynchronous comprehensions and generators in Python, especially as described in PEP 530.

## Overview

In this repository, we dive deep into:

- **Asynchronous Generators**: Functions that allow yielding between asynchronous operations.
- **Asynchronous Comprehensions**: A mechanism to use comprehensions over asynchronous iterators.
- **Type Annotations**: Python's own mechanism to hint the type of variables, making code more self-explanatory.
